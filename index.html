      <p>You're a professional web designer working freelance. You're talking to a prospective client. He's telling you his vision for his new website idea. You're giving feedback that's immeadiatly resonating with him. Everything is going swimmingly. You arrive at the topic of price. You quote him for the entire projectâ€” research, wireframing, design, execution, revisions. He looks startled. Almost angry. Then he delivers the one-liner that has all but alienated designers world wide:</p>

      <p>"Why does this cost so much?"</p>

      <p>As a designer, you want to shut down. You think to yourself "Red flag, no thanks". As you start backing down from the project, the client is validated in thinking that design isn't worth what you're charging. If it was, you wouldn't be paying for your salad and sprinting out the door.</p>

      <p>What happened here? No, it's not the prospective client's fault. It's yours.</p>

      <p>People who want to buy design think they're paying someone with photoshop to get out their computer and draw them some pretty shit that will magically help them sell whatever it may be that they're selling.</p>

      <p>We're professional designers. We know better. We know better than <span class="italic">anyone</span> else what goes into a successful project, and if a client isn't willing to give that to us right off the bat, we dismiss them as ignorant and walk away, all the while scoffing about them to our collegues.</p>

      <p>Of course clients can be ignorant! They're not designers. They don't know how the design process works anymore than you or I know how the butchering process works at a meat store. And perhaps the reason that it seems like people are out to rip us all off is because when it comes to sitting down face to face with a client, when we start talking money and they start balking, we give up on them.</p>

      <h2>Show Them Value</h2>

      <p>Let's say you've never heard of Apple computers before. I know, it's a long shot, but just try for the sake of arguement. Now, you walk into your local Best Buy with the intent of purchasing a new computer. You look at two different models. A MacBook Pro and a Dell Whatever (I literally have no idea what computers Dell makes, but it's just an analogy so it's fine). The two computers have identical specs. The only difference as far as you can tell is the MacBook Pro is very pretty to look at but it's also 3 times as much. Is that superfluous athestic going to cause you to spend $1,800 instead of $600? No, of course not. You don't see the value in the MacBook over the Dell.</p>
